# artlab

Artlab is a web application for helping fine artists connect with each other for the purpose of collaborating on projects.
As an artist, you can set up your own profile, create photo galleries, and add tags to your account to help others find you.
Reach out to others by publishing an ad for an open project you'd like to collaborate on, or browse ads for what suits you.
